# Image Search

This project is a dynamic and user-friendly web application that leverages the Unsplash API to provide users with a seamless experience in searching and exploring a vast collection of high-quality images. 
The application features a clean and intuitive user interface where users can input their search queries and instantly see relevant and stunning images from the Unsplash database.

Users can click on individual images to view detailed information such as the photographer's name, image dimensions, and a link to the original image on Unsplash.
To enhance user experience, the application incorporates pagination, enabling users to navigate through multiple pages of search results.
